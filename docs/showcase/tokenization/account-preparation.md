Welcome to the BNB Chain Tokenization Tutorial.

Tokenization is a process by which you create a digital token that can be traded on a blockchain. Tokenization has opened up a new way for businesses to create new revenue streams and help small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) to access funding and grow their businesses.

BNB Chain's multi-chain framework, including BSC, opBNB, and Greenfield, offers scalability, low costs, and secure data storage, making it ideal for SMEs to start their tokenization journey. 

There are different sceneraios of tokenization, but in general, you need to prepare a wallet account and buy some crypto before you start create token.
