# BNB On-Chain Governance Voting: A BNB Advocate`s Guide

# Introduction

Key Opinion Leaders (BNB Advocates) hold significant influence within the BNB Chain community. Your participation in on-chain governance is vital to ensure the network evolves in a truly decentralized manner. By maximizing your voting power, you can amplify your community's voice and drive positive change.

# How to Increase Voting Power

**As a tech leader, there are two primary ways to enhance your governance power:**

1. Increase your BNB holdings: The more BNB you hold in your wallet, the more voting power you possess. Consider acquiring additional BNB to boost your influence in governance decisions.
2. Receive delegated BNB: Encourage your community members to delegate their voting power to you. This empowers you to vote on their behalf, increasing your overall influence in the governance process.

**Steps to Gain More Voting Power from Your Community**

1. Educate and Advocate: Explain the importance of on-chain governance and how it empowers the community to shape the future of BNB Chain. Clearly articulate the benefits of delegating voting power to you as a trusted tech leader.
2. Share Proposals and Insights: Regularly share your thoughts on upcoming proposals and explain how they might impact the community. Provide insightful analysis and encourage your followers to engage in the discussion.
3. Simplify Delegation: Make the delegation process as easy as possible for your community. Provide clear instructions and guidance on how to delegate their voting power to you.
4. Transparent Communication: Maintain open and transparent communication with your community. Keep them informed about how you plan to utilize their delegated voting power and the rationale behind your voting decisions.
5. Build Trust: Continuously build trust with your community by demonstrating your commitment to their interests and the overall well-being of the BNB Chain ecosystem.
