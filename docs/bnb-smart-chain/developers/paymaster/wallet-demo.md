# Experience Paymaster in mainstream Wallets

Several mainstream cryptocurrency wallets have already implemented Paymaster integration.
This tutorial will guide you through the experience of sending gasless transactions in paymaster integrated wallets.


## Paymaster Integrated Wallets

Wallets with integrated Paymaster functionality offer a seamless experience for users. 
These wallets automatically detect whether a transaction is eligible for sponsorship. 
When a transaction qualifies, the wallet sets the gas price to zero without any user intervention. 

To illustrate this, we'll walk through the process by transferring stable coin on BSC.
